- It was an awesome project , it was my beginning with laravel framework , 
it was my first time to use git , make commits and pushes , rollback to previous version in new branch and edit on it .

- I tried to understand the work environment in the store like buy , sell , 
relations between the models like Products and companies and their types and the functionality in store .

- using ajax was great ,it was so exciting while i see page didn't reload and data changing ,
functions return json to frontend to achieve to ajax concept .
 
- I faced a lot of problems , i fixed that by search and asked my friends in my field , it was a challenge but it done .

- Tools& technologies : PHP , Laravel Framework , Html , Css , MySql , ajax , javascript and MVC .
